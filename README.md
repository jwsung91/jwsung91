# Jinwoo Sung

A robotics software engineer focused on field-proven, user-oriented development.

I have 7+ years of experience in industrial and service robotics, specializing in designing and maintaining ROS 2-based systems deployed in real environments.

I believe that software must be verified in practice and implemented with clarity, structure, and maintainability.

My development approach is solution-driven, with a focus on integration, automation, and long-term reliability.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Focus on **structure and modularity**, not just features  
- Design with **user feedback** and **deployment conditions** in mind  
- Build software ecosystems that support **long-term maintainability** and team scalability
